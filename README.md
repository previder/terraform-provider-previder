# Previder Provider

The Previder provider is used to interact with resources on the Previder IaaS environment. 
The provider needs to be configured with an API token that will be provided by Previder.

Before using this README, make sure that you have installed the Previder Provider using INSTALL.

## Motivation

As projects besides e.g. the Previder Portal, the development team at Previder develops and maintains multiple projects aiming to integrate the Previder IaaS environment.

## API Reference

This project uses the API client from the [previder-go-sdk](https://github.com/previder/previder-go-sdk) project.
